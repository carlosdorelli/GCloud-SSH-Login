A list of necessary commands to allow root SSH login in your GCloud Plataform VM.

---

## Let's go ðŸ˜Ž
```sh
1. Access your SSH Terminal via GCloud Plataform
2. Type "sudo su root" that will log you into root
3. Define a password to the user root using "passwd root"
4. Now its time to permit into the machine the login using root user, type "nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config"
5. Now that we are on sshd_config, lets permit the RootLogin and the PasswordAutentication. Go to "#ListenAddress ::" and add below "PermitRootLogin yes" then jump another line and add "PasswordAuthentication yes"
6. Now lets save and close the file - do Control X + Y + Enter
7. So then we restart the sshd service and it's done - "service sshd restart"
```
Now it's just login into your Virtual Machine using the user root and the password you wrote in the third step.

## Fast Copy and Paste âŒ¨
```sh
sudo su root
passwd root
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# Add these two lines below #ListenAddress ::
PermitRootLogin yes
PasswordAuthentication yes
service sshd restart
```
